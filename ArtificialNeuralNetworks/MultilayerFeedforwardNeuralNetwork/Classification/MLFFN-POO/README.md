## Usage
Ensure GraphViz (https://www.graphviz.org/) is properly installed in your system.

```bash
> sudo yum install graphviz
```

*Activate your environment. In my case it's called 'tensorflow' and install libraries if needed.

```bash
> source activate tensorflow
> pip install seaborn
> pip install pydot
> pip install graphviz
```

* Execute:
```bash
> python main.py
  or  
> python3 main.py
```
