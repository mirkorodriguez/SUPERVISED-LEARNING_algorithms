# Multilayer Feedforward Neural Network

This example uses Keras and Tensorflow to implemement a classification ANN for client churn in a bank.
The implementation uses OOP principles.

## Usage
Ensure GraphViz (https://www.graphviz.org/) is properly installed in your system.

```bash
> sudo yum install graphviz
```

*Install libraries and activate your environment if needed (my env is called 'tensorflow').

```bash
> source activate tensorflow
> pip install seaborn
> pip install pydot
> pip install graphviz
```

* Execute:
```bash
> python main.py
  or  
> python3 main.py
```
