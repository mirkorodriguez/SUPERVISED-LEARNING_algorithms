# Multilayer Feedforward Neural Network

This example uses Keras and Tensorflow to implemement a classification ANN for client churn in a bank.
The implementation uses OOP principles.

## Usage
*Activate your environment. In my case it's called 'tensorflow'

```bash
> source activate tensorflow
> python main.py
  or  
> python3 main.py
```
